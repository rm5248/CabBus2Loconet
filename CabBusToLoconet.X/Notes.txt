1. PowerCab sends out a ping every ~5 MS
2. 900ms does not seem to be a hard and fast rule.
3. DelayUs seems to be ~double the time specified.  Don't use it.
4. The PowerCab looks like it draws .06A on boot, and .09A when being used as a PowerCab.
   Not sure which is more representative.
5. Voltage Regulator = MC7805CT
6. For the voltage regulator, 9v in will give us 5v out
